at this repository you may find Reinforcement Learning Algorithm codes.

I have tried to classify codes in different categories based on their technical and mathematic foundation. 

Overal, we can find 4 different types of RL algorithms and I also provided 4 different folders for each one.

if you have previous knowledge about different RL you can easily find the code which is desirable for you. 

for each code there will be a PDF file helping you to understand the main building blocks of code.
