at this folder you can find implementation for two of the most known Tabular methods Q_Learning and Expected SARSA.

for detailed information about each algorithm you can refer to PDF file in folder.

in first python file "Tabular_TD0_QLearning_CliffWorld":
you will find Q_Learning implemented to solve CliffWorld ENV.

then, in "Tabular_TD0_QLearning_VS_ExpectedSarsa_CliffWorld":
Q_Learning and Expected Sarsa are compared for CliffWorld ENV.

you can easily change the env in both module and try to find some intuition about each code.

"My_Agent" module is the implementation of agent and it is imported on other modules.
